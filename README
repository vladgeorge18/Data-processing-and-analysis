Task 1: Removes exceptions using static methods (e1)
Calculates for each window the mean and deviation

Task 2.1: Removes noise using median filtering (e2)

Task 2.2: Eliminates noise using the mean value filtering (e3)

Task 3: Handles non-uniform frequency data (u)

Task 4: Filling in the data (c)

Task 5: Data statistics (st<delta>, delta-interval length)
It shows how much data there is in certain intervals

How to run:
Run arguments (e1, e2, e3, u, c, st<delta>) on the command line.
